# Documentation for Pro Reports for Wild Apricot


# Project Description
Wild Apricot is the #1 rated Membership Management platform that enables membership-based organizations to manage their contact database and all members transactions with ease. The system has many modules including events, membership renewals, donations and an online store. It also enables administrators to customize their contact and member database. Members and administrators are able to manipulate data such as membership status, event registration, online payments with ease.

The built in reporting system in Wild Apricot does not allow easy summarization and visualization of Wild Apricot member and contact transactions. The comprehensive real-time report capabilities in Google Data Studio are a perfect solution that helps administrators integrate Wild Apricot data with a variety of external analytical systems like Google Ads and Google Analytics. This project is a Google Data Studio community data connector built to retrieve data from Wild Apricot, which can be summarized and transformed in GDS to create user-friendly and real-time dashboard for Wild Apricot.

Data is fetched in real-time, securely using Wild Apricot's REST API.

The code is maintained by [NewPath Consulting](https://www.newpathconsulting.com/warm).

# Installation

This is a community connector. When you purchase a license you will receive the link to the connector in your email with the Pro Reports license.

To use the connector you can perform one of 2 procedures:

* Create your own Wild Apricot data source with [this connector link](https://datastudio.google.com/datasources/create?connectorId=AKfycbzCDTl62VlYZZd5NIqQ1RFmeUdG71a004N5dGqDyAORuZCQLkcSY2Ygsp4tGgEAbR4W)

or

* Install the code in the /src folder and install it using the [GDS deployment procedures](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/deploy).

After the data source is configured you will be asked for a [Wild Apricot API key](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/484). API keys can be created in the Wild Apricot administrative system under [Settings/Integrations/Authorized Applications](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/180)

## Edit and Use your own copy of the Pro Reports

1.  Visit [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new
    project.
2.  In the Apps Script development environment, select **View > Show manifest
    file**. Replace the contents of this file with the content of the
    `src/appsscript.json` file from this repository.
3.  For every `.js` file under `src`, you will need to create a file in Apps
    Scripts (**File > New > Script File**), then copy over the content from the
    repository.
4.  To use the Community Connector in Data Studio, follow the
    [guide on Community Connector Developer site](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/use).
